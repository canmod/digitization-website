# digitization-website

This is the landing page for the historical Canadian digitization project.

There are three goals with this page:

1. Flashly/impressive visual experience when you first arrive
2. Visual description of the high-level of the digitization process
3. Links/buttons to important locations for the project, with visual indications of what is behind each link -- here's a good starting set, but it should be reasonably easy to add other links
    * https://github.com/canmod/iidda
    * API documentation site (I know this isn't up yet, but for now maybe just point to localhost:8000??)
    * Shiny API (again I know it isn't live yet)
    * https://github.com/canmod/iidda-tools
    * future -- link to our page on https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca/repo/
